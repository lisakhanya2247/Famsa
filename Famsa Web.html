    <p>FAMSA Western Cape is a non-profit organisation (NPO) specialising in relationship
        counselling. We believe that “healthy families create healthy communities” and are
        the foundation of our society. Secure families provide a favourable environment where
         family members can develop to their full potential, develop positive identities and 
        form a set of values that serve as a frame of reference for life.
        
        Families come in many forms including: extended families, single parent families, gay 
        couples (with or without children), nuclear families, child headed families, childless 
        couples, cohabiting couples and combined families. FAMSA recognises all forms of family 
        and strives to make a positive impact in our communities through our counselling and 
        support services.</p>
